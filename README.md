## common js import and export 
This is the common way to export and import functions or variables. However, nowadays it no recommended to use it.
All the files js are already made to work with common js, so if we want to force these files. we write in one file *name_file.cjs* instead of just *name_file.js*. Files with examples.
**one_cjs**.
